# Kevin Nyagaka's Portfolio Website 
 
Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my skills as a full-stack developer, featuring dynamic content, a project portfolio, a contact form, and a preview of my CryptoWorld blog. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this site reflects my passion for innovative web development. 
 
## Overview 
This is a static portfolio website designed to highlight my technical expertise and projects. It includes a welcome page with a dynamic counter, an about page with a skills showcase, a portfolio page with featured projects, and a contact page with a form. A blog preview links to my external CryptoWorld blog, where I explore crypto trends and airdrops.
